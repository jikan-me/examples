## examples

Code examples for interacting with the [Jikan](http://github.com/jikan-me/jikan)

If you have an example that covers one of the [wrappers](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan#wrappers)/languages or an endpoint which isn't covered by the examples here, feel free to create a [PR](https://github.com/jikan-me/examples/compare)!

- If a wrapper requires using a package manager to install, include the entire folder structure necessary to run an example, not just individual snippets of code
